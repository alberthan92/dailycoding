# Daily Coding

I have started to learn programming about a year ago. In the fall of 2016, I have attended a web programming bootcamp for 3 months. In the summer of 2017, I have attended a one month programming camp called the "piscine" at 42 in California. The objective of this project is not only to review what I have learned during these programs but also to keep programming to become a better developer.
